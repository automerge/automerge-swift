     Summation from https://www.donnywals.com/enabling-concurrency-warnings-in-xcode-14/
     Set `strict-concurrency` to `targeted` to enforce Sendable and actor-isolation
     checks in your code. This explicitly verifies that `Sendable` constraints are
     met when you mark one of your types as `Sendable`.

     This mode is essentially a bit of a hybrid between the behavior that's intended
     in Swift 6, and the default in Swift 5.7. Use this mode to have a bit of
     checking on your code that uses Swift concurrency without too many warnings
     and / or errors in your current codebase.

     Set `strict-concurrency` to `complete` to get the full suite of concurrency
     constraints, essentially as they will work in Swift 6.
